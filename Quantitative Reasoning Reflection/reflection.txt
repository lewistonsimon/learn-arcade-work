Quantitative Reasoning Reflection

Question 1

    A code requires a lot of different parts to make it run correctly. An if
statement is needed when choosing between two situations so that the correct code
will be run. An if statement can also be used to see if a condition is met, such
as if thirst < 2, print "you are thirsty." We can use lists to store data or
multiple characters for later on. Loops are beneficial when we need to
do something multiple times or until a condition is met. Looping will give you the
ability to search through a list and find the element that is needed.
    Functions are used when code is going to be reused multiple times. It eliminates
the need for you to rewrite multiple lines of code to get an outcome, and it
allows us to move something like a drawing around by just putting in coordinates.
Classes can help simplify code by eliminating the need to push a bunch of
parameters into a function, and makes it easier to add attributes without
having to go through and changing the parameters.

Question 2

    comments, specific descriptive variables, grouping like code together, check ins,
    keep track of your changes, documentation - write how an algorithms works.

    To communicate a code with another programmer it is important to make it easy
to read. By placing comments in the code, other programmers can read them and
get an idea of how that section of code works. It is also important to use
descriptive variable names that will let someone know exactly what that
variable represents. It is better to have a variable called temperature rather
than t because t could be anything. Grouping like code together also makes the
code easier to follow. If someone is looking for a part of the code it is
better if they can find all the code they want in one area rather than searching
through the entire program.
    It is also important to communicate the changes that have been made to your
program. When pushing to the server it could be beneficial if you describe what
has been worked on in that session of work. Maybe the simplest way to communicate
your program to other programmers is to write down how the algorithms work. This
could be done in a comment section or on a website that could be linked to your
work.

Question 3

    run the code to see if there is an error, inspect the error to figure out where it is,
    run code to see if you get the desired outcome,

    Testing your code is important to make sure that it works the way it is
meant to run. The easiest way to test to see if your code works is by running it
to see if an error occurs. If an error occurs, you can search through the stack
trace and find the location of the error, and then you can search in that spot and
fix the problem. It is always reasonable to ask a question if you can not find out
where the error is. It is important to ask detailed questions and to be very
specific in explaining what is wrong.
    There are times when the code runs without errors, but it is not the desired
outcome. In this case you can run code to see if you get the outcome that you
wanted. By placing print statements after things like for loops and on key pressed
functions, we can tell if they are running and where the code stops being triggered.
By narrowing it down you can focus on the part that does not work.




Question 4

    mess things up on algorithms, not diverse set up of opinions, evaluated on stats,
    only defined by stats,

    Numerical methods are a great tool to be used, but they have limitations. They
first have to be set up, and it is possible that a mistake can be made by the
programmer. The numerical method can only do what it is programmed to, so a mistake
in the setup would have repercussions later on.
    Numerical methods can also only evaluate the stats. It can not bring in any
logic or reasoning behind why a stat is the way it is.
