Question 1

    You use an if statement

Question 2

    comments, specific descriptive variables, grouping like code together, check ins,
    keep track of your changes, documention - write how an algorithms works.

    To communicate a code with another programmer it is important to make it easy
to read. By placing comments in the code, other programmers can read them and
get an idea of how that section of code works. It is also important to use
descriptive variable names that will let someone know exactly what that
variable represents. It is better to have a variable called temperature rather
than t because t could be anything. Grouping like code together also makes the
code easier to follow. If someone is looking for a part of the code it is
better if they can find all the code they want in one area rather than searching
through the entire program.
    It is also important to communicate the changes that have been made to your
program. When pushing to the server it could be benifical if you describe what
has been worked on in that session of work. Maybe the simplist way to communicate
your program to other programmers is to write down how the algorithms work. This
could be done in a comment section or on a website that could be linked to your
work.


Question 3

    run the code to see if there is an error, inspect the error to figure out where it is,
    run code to see if you get the desired outcome,

    Testing your code is important to make sure that it works the way it is
meant to run. One way to handle this check is by running your code after you work
on it. You need to make sure that you are recieving the desired outcome.

Question 4

    mess things up on algorithms, not dievers set up of opinions, evaluated on stats,
    only defined by stats,
